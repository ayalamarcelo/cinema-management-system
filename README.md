## Requirements

- [x] JDK 17
- [x] Apache Tomcat 9.0
- [x] MySQL
- [x] Maven

## Environment Configuration

**Database**

1. Create a database in MySQL (Copy the one from the resource folder `movies_db.sql`)
2. Clone repository (It is recommended to do a FORK)

``` bsh
git clone https://github.com/username/cinema-management-system.git
```
   
3. Configure Apache Tomcat to deploy the application.

> [!NOTE]
> Change port in Apache Tomcat

```dtd
Connector port=”8090″ protocol=”HTTP/1.1″ connectionTimeout=”20000″ redirectPort=”8443″
```

## Use
Use your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) or Tomcat Manager to deploy the project.
Verify that the root path (index.jsp) is working properly.

*Endpoints*:

* GET /movies/{id}: Gets a movie by ID.
* POST /movies Create a new movie.
* PUT /movies/{id}: Update an existing movie.
* DELETE /movies/{id}: Delete a movie by ID.

> [!TIP]
> For PUTs on postman: 
> 1. Select: Body
> 2. Select: Rows
> 3. Paste a JSON on rows:

```json
{
  "id":1,
  "title":"The Lord of the Rings",
  "director": "Peter Jackson",
  "genre": "Fantasy"
}
```

### Final Notes

- Make sure your MySQL and Tomcat services are up and properly configured.
- Check and update database credentials in DatabaseConnection.java if needed.
